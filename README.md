## ▶️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sachin-R-star/Python-ML-Project.git
cd Python-ML-Project
```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn’t exist yet, you can install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `CategoryClassifier.ipynb` and run the cells.
